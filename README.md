# Java Basics Module Final Exercise

## Overview
This project implements a system to track university classes, teachers, and students. The system includes functionality to manage teachers (both full-time and part-time), students, and classes. Teachers have a name, salary, and experience, while students have a name, ID, and age. The system allows users to manage and view class data, assign students to classes, and print details about the system's entities.

## Java Version
This project is built using Java **1.8.0_202**.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java **1.8.0_202** or higher
- A command-line terminal (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal, or PowerShell)

## Cloning the Repository

To copy the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash

```

## Compiling and Running the Java Exercise
1. Navigate to the src folder:
```bash
cd src
```
2. Compile the Main.java file:

Use the javac command to compile the Main.java file. Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
javac Main.java
```

3. Run the Program:

After successful compilation, you can run the program using the java command:
```bash
java Main
```

This will execute the program and allow you to interact with the university system.
## Exercise Details
### Project Description

The goal is to create a system for managing university teachers, students, and classes. The system should:

    Initialize at least 2 teachers of each type (full-time and part-time).
    Initialize at least 6 different students.
    Initialize at least 4 different classes, each with its teacher, students, and relevant data.
    Provide a menu with the following options:
        a. Print all professors with their data.
        b. Print all classes and a submenu to select a class in order to print its data, including the teacher and students.
        c. Create a new student and add it to an existing class.
        d. Create a new class and add an existing teacher, existing students, and relevant data.
        e. List all classes in which a given student is included (search by ID).
        f. Exit.
